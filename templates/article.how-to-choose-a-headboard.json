A general recommendation is that if you have either a twin- or full-size mattress, you should have a headboard which is at least as wide as the mattress; however, for larger ones like a queen or king size mattress, it should be able to stick out more than just covering the top. But you may wish to use an extended one to enhance its appearance.<\/p>"}},"question_hFQFK7":{"type":"question","settings":{"icon":"none","heading":"What are the best materials for headboards in the UK climate?","text":"<p>Since the weather can often become wet in Britain, you should opt for materials that can resist moisture as well as prevent moulds from developing on them. Some could consider using an upholstered fabric headboard made up of breathable fabric. An alternative option could be to create one out of leather because it tends not only to stay longer but also to remain clean. On another hand, if someone wants a more traditional look they could go ahead and use wooden boards protected by various finishes against water damage.<\/p>"}},"question_YEyCEW":{"type":"question","settings":{"icon":"none","heading":"How do I choose a headboard that agrees with my bedroom style?","text":"<p>You must consider your entire bedroom style when selecting a headboard. For a modernistic appeal, go for plain lines and neutral colours. A traditional style bedroom goes for ornately styled and upholstered headboards. Those who want to explore bohemian vibes should select unique patterned or natural<br\/>material headboards.<\/p>"}},"question_c4PrNW":{"type":"question","settings":{"icon":"none","heading":"What is the price range of headboards in the UK?","text":"<p>Headboard prices differ widely according to materials, size or even construction style. They start from as low as £50 cheap ones through high-ends – which cost several thousand pounds.<\/p>"}},"question_YCMdCD":{"type":"question","settings":{"icon":"none","heading":"Can I install a headboard myself?","text":"<p>Most of the time, you can set them up yourself with simple equipment. On the other hand, some bigger and more complicated ones may need expert installation. Always verify product instructions for precise directions.<\/p>"}}},"block_order":["question_F7hbPc","question_hFQFK7","question_YEyCEW","question_c4PrNW","question_YCMdCD"],"settings":{"heading":"Frequently Asked Questions","heading_align":"text-center","color_scheme":"1","full_width":true}},"article-comments":{"type":"article-comments","settings":{}}},"order":["main","faq_X7eUiG","article-comments"]}
