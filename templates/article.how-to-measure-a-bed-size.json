Put the mattress on a flat surface and measure from one side to the other to get its width. For the length, go from the top to the bottom. Keep the tape straight and at a 90-degree angle to your bed to get accurate bed measurements.<\/p>"}},"question_YEyCEW":{"type":"question","settings":{"icon":"none","heading":"What do I need to know before measuring for the right size bed frame to fit the mattress?","text":"<p>When considering a bed frame always check the internal dimensions of the mattress and measure where your mattress goes. For more details see here: The internal width and length of the bed frame must be equal to or slightly larger than the mattress measurements that should fit on it comfortably. Be aware of not only the amount of space that's needed by footing and headboards but also how tall a frame can be.<\/p>"}},"question_c4PrNW":{"type":"question","settings":{"icon":"none","heading":"Why is it important to measure the area around the bed and what's the best way to do it?","text":"<p>Let us measure the space around where you lie down so that way we allow enough area to move other furniture pieces like nightstands. To ensure this, measure the distance between your bed and other pieces of furniture or walls. A full 60 cm (2 feet) is best, as this will ensure unrestricted access and help foster comfort in the room.<\/p>"}},"question_YCMdCD":{"type":"question","settings":{"icon":"none","heading":"How to measure the height of your bed going from the floor to the top of the mattress?","text":"<p>To measure the height of the bed from floor to top of the mattress place one end of tape on beside where the base is. Pull the tape measure straight up to the top of the mattress. Set the tape flat and at a right angle to the ground to get a more accurate measurement.<\/p>"}}},"block_order":["question_F7hbPc","question_hFQFK7","question_YEyCEW","question_c4PrNW","question_YCMdCD"],"settings":{"heading":"Frequently Asked Questions","heading_align":"text-center","color_scheme":"1","full_width":true}},"article-comments":{"type":"article-comments","settings":{}}},"order":["main","faq_X7eUiG","article-comments"]}
